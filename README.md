# JS30-Mouse-Shadow

This project gave me the opportunity to practice modifying the styling of a given HTML element given the location of the cursor using offsetX and offsetY. The styling is determined by the present location of the mouse and updates as the mouse moves.

Though not related to the goal of this project, this project did also introduce me to the HTML attribute "contenteditable," which was new to me, though I find it to be a very interesting feature that I didn't realize could be done without JavaScript, but rather with HTML alone.
